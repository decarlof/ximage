    This is an example of a module level function.

    Ref.:
    http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html#example-numpy

    Function parameters should be documented in the ``Parameters`` section.
    The name of each parameter is required. The type and description of each
    parameter is optional, but should be included if not obvious.

    If \*args or \*\*kwargs are accepted,
    they should be listed as ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.

    The format for a parameter is::

        name : type
            description

            The description may span multiple lines. Following lines
            should be indented to match the first line of the description.
            The ": type" is optional.

            Multiple paragraphs are supported in parameter
            descriptions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parameter_01 : int
        The first parameter.
    parameter_02 : :obj:`str`, optional
        The second parameter.
    parameter_03 : :obj:`str`, optional
        The second parameter.
    *args
        Variable length argument list.
    **kwargs
        Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if successful, False otherwise.

        The return type is not optional. The ``Returns`` section may span
        multiple lines and paragraphs. Following lines should be indented to
        match the first line of the description.

        The ``Returns`` section supports any reStructuredText formatting,
        including literal blocks::

            {
                'param1': param1,
                'param2': param2
            }

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        The ``Raises`` section is a list of all exceptions
        that are relevant to the interface.
    ValueError
        If `param2` is equal to `param1`.



    Examples
    --------
    Examples should be written in doctest format, and should illustrate how
    to use the function.

    >>> print([i for i in example_generator(4)])
    [0, 1, 2, 3]
